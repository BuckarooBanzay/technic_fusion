**State**: Draft

* [ ] Uranium to Lead decay abm
* [ ] Lithium ore
* [ ] Lithium block
* [ ] Tritium (from irradiating lithium)
* [ ] Deuterium (from heavy water)
* [ ] Fusion reactor, consumes tritium and deuterium, produces ca. 500MEU power

# TODO

## Textures

* [ ] lithium ore
* [ ] lithium block
* [ ] Fusion rector (blue "normal" reactor?)

## Tools

Gas capture thing?

## Nodes

### Lithium ore

### Lithium block

### Tritium

In gas state, vanishes if air is nearby.
Capturing with gas capture tool.

### Deuterium

Dito "Tritium"

### Fusion reactor

Emits 50+ MEU power but needs some power to start (fission-fusion start).


## ABM's

### Litihium irradiation

Happens if a 3.5 uranium block is near a lithium block.
Emits Tritium and converts the uranium to lead.
